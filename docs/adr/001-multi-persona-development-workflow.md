# ADR-001: Multi-Persona Development Workflow

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a structured approach to software development that ensures quality, maintainability, and stakeholder satisfaction. Traditional development approaches often lack clear role definitions and quality gates, leading to inconsistent output and unclear responsibility chains.

## Decision
Implement a multi-persona development workflow with 6 distinct personas:
- [ARCHITECT] - Research and design
- [CODER] - Implementation 
- [TESTER] - Testing and validation
- [REVIEWER] - Code review
- [QA] - Quality assurance
- [STAKEHOLDER] - Final approval

Each persona has specific responsibilities and must hand off work through documented checkpoints.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear role separation ensures all aspects of development are covered
- Multiple quality gates catch issues early
- Complete documentation trail for all decisions and changes
- Stakeholder control ensures requirements are truly met
- Structured hand-offs prevent work from falling through cracks

### Negative
- More overhead than simple development approaches
- Requires discipline to follow the process consistently
- May feel slow for very simple changes
- Requires all personas to maintain documentation

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Simple pair programming** - Lacks structure and documentation
2. **Traditional agile sprints** - Less collaborative, harder to track quality
3. **Code review only** - Misses architecture and testing perspectives
