## Gating Rules for Hand-offs

- No code edits may occur without a completed persona handoff and explicit acceptance criteria.
- Each handoff MUST include: Completed Work, Next Steps, Notes, and current test status (failing/passing).
- The receiving persona MUST acknowledge the handoff and restate objectives before proceeding.
- If any required handoff information is missing, the assistant MUST block and request completion before continuing.
