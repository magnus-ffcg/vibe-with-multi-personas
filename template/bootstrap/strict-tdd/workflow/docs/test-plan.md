# Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy and specifications for the current feature development.

## Current Feature
*[To be updated by TEST_ARCHITECT with feature details]*

## Test Architecture

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Acceptance Tests**: Test complete user scenarios and requirements

### Test Specifications
*[To be updated by TEST_ARCHITECT with detailed test specifications]*

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage for new functionality
- All acceptance criteria must have corresponding tests
- Edge cases and error conditions must be tested

## Test Implementation Status

### RED Phase (Failing Tests)
- [ ] Unit tests implemented and failing
- [ ] Integration tests implemented and failing  
- [ ] Acceptance tests implemented and failing

### GREEN Phase (Passing Tests)
- [ ] All tests passing with minimal implementation

### REFACTOR Phase (Maintained Tests)
