# Hand-offs Documentation (Cursor IDE)

This document tracks all persona-to-persona hand-offs in the multi-persona development workflow for Cursor IDE projects.

## Hand-off Template

```markdown
### [TIMESTAMP] [FROM_PERSONA] → [TO_PERSONA]
**Task**: [Task description or ID]
**Completed**: [What was accomplished]
**Next Steps**: [What needs to be done next]
**Notes**: [Any important context or blockers]
**Files Updated**: [List of files modified]
**Cursor Features Used**: [Specific Cursor IDE features utilized]
```

## Active Hand-offs

### [2024-12-19 15:30] [ARCHITECT] → [CODER]
**Task**: Create Basic CLI Structure (Task 1 from backlog)
**Completed**: 
- Created comprehensive project plan in `/docs/plan.md`
- Defined task backlog in `/docs/backlog.md` with 7 prioritized tasks
- Established Go CLI architecture using Cobra, Viper, and Logrus
- Defined project structure and design principles
- Set clear acceptance criteria for all tasks

**Next Steps**: 
- Implement Task 1: Create Basic CLI Structure
- Initialize Go module with dependencies (Cobra, Viper, Logrus)
- Create project directory structure (cmd/, internal/, docs/, tests/)
- Implement root command with Cobra framework
- Ensure CLI can be built and run with basic help system

**Notes**: 
- Follow the project structure defined in `/docs/plan.md`
- Use the acceptance criteria from `/docs/backlog.md` Task 1
- This is the foundation task - all other tasks depend on this
- Focus on getting a working CLI that can be built and executed

**Files Updated**: 
- `/docs/plan.md` - Complete project architecture and design
- `/docs/backlog.md` - 7 prioritized tasks with acceptance criteria
- `.cursor/rules/hand-offs.mdc` - This hand-off documentation

**Cursor Features Used**: 
- File creation and editing for documentation
- Project structure analysis and planning
- Multi-persona workflow coordination

## Cursor IDE Specific Guidelines

### Hand-off Best Practices
- Document which Cursor features were used during the work phase
- Include any Cursor-generated code or suggestions in the hand-off notes
- Mention any Cursor AI insights that influenced decisions
- Note any Cursor-specific configurations or settings applied

### Communication in Cursor
- Use Cursor's chat interface for persona communication
- Leverage @mentions for clear persona transitions
- Document AI-assisted decisions in hand-off notes
- Include Cursor workspace context when relevant

### Feature Usage Documentation
When handing off, document:
- **ARCHITECT**: Analysis and research using Cursor's chat
- **CODER**: Code generation, Apply features, refactoring tools used
- **TESTER**: Test generation capabilities, debugging tools utilized
- **REVIEWER**: Code analysis features, security scanning results
- **QA**: Testing frameworks, validation tools employed

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure all Cursor-generated code is reviewed and validated
- Document any manual modifications to AI suggestions
- Include performance impact of Cursor-assisted implementations
- Note any Cursor-specific dependencies or configurations
