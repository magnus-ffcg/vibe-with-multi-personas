## Windsurf Cascade Specific Guidelines

### Hand-off Best Practices
- Document which Windsurf features were used during the work phase
- Include any AI pair programming insights that influenced decisions
- Mention Windsurf workspace context that was leveraged
- Note any Cascade-specific configurations or settings applied

### Communication in Windsurf
- Use Windsurf's chat interface for persona communication
- Leverage @mentions for clear persona transitions
- Document AI-assisted decisions in hand-off notes
- Include Windsurf workspace context when relevant

### Feature Usage Documentation
When handing off, document:
- **ARCHITECT**: Analysis and research using Windsurf's context awareness
- **CODER**: AI pair programming features, integrated debugging tools used
- **TESTER**: Testing frameworks, AI test generation capabilities utilized
- **REVIEWER**: Code analysis features, collaborative review tools employed
- **QA**: Validation frameworks, comprehensive testing tools used

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure all Windsurf-assisted work is documented and validated
- Document any manual modifications to AI suggestions
- Include performance impact of Windsurf-assisted implementations
- Note any Windsurf-specific dependencies or configurations

### Strict Role Enforcement
- ARCHITECT must hand off to CODER for all implementation work
- CODER has exclusive authority for code modifications
- All personas must respect workflow boundaries
- Document any role enforcement issues in hand-offs
