# Project Plan: Windsurf Cascade Bootstrap Template

This document contains design notes and architectural decisions for the Windsurf Cascade Bootstrap Template project.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a best-in-class bootstrap template that provides a complete multi-persona development workflow system for both Windsurf Cascade and Cursor IDE projects.

**Vision**: Any developer should be able to copy this template and immediately have access to:
- Structured 6-persona workflow (ARCHITECT → CODER → TESTER → REVIEWER → QA → STAKEHOLDER)
- Complete documentation templates
- Quality gates and hand-off protocols
- Self-demonstrating example of the workflow in action

## Current Design

### Architecture
The template follows a structured multi-persona development workflow with clear persona definitions and documentation practices, supporting both Windsurf Cascade and Cursor IDE environments.

### Key Components
- **Personas System**: Six defined roles (ARCHITECT, CODER, TESTER, REVIEWER, QA, STAKEHOLDER)
- **Workflow Pipeline**: Linear progression from Backlog to Complete
- **Multi-IDE Support**: Dual configuration structure for Windsurf (.windsurf/) and Cursor (.cursor/)
- **Documentation Structure**: IDE-agnostic workflow docs with IDE-specific configurations
- **Bootstrap Automation**: Shell script with IDE detection and setup
- **GitHub Installation**: Remote installation capability via repository URLs

### Installation Methods
1. **Local Bootstrap**: `./bootstrap.sh /path/to/project "Project Name"`
2. **GitHub Installation**: `bash <(curl -s URL/install.sh) GITHUB_URL /path/to/project "Project Name"`

## Design Decisions

### 1. All Documentation in `/docs/`
**Rationale**: Centralized location prevents confusion and duplication
**Trade-off**: Slightly longer paths, but much cleaner organization

### 2. Template-First README
**Rationale**: Users need to understand this is a template, not a project
**Trade-off**: Less detailed workflow explanation in README, but clearer purpose

### 3. Self-Referential Workflow
**Rationale**: Best way to demonstrate and validate the workflow is to use it
**Trade-off**: More overhead for simple changes, but proves the system works

## Dependencies

- **Windsurf Cascade**: AI pair programming environment
- **Git**: Version control and template distribution
- **Markdown**: Documentation format (no external dependencies)

## Future Considerations

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Complete documentation templates
- Working bootstrap instructions
- Self-referential workflow adoption

### Phase 2 (Future)
- Bootstrap automation script
- Template examples and samples
- Integration with GitHub template features
- Community feedback incorporation
